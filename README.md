# Budgeting App

A SwiftUI and SwiftData budgeting app. Open `Budgeting App.xcodeproj` in Xcode and select the shared **Budgeting App** scheme.

## Open the project

Extract the downloaded ZIP into its own folder, then double-click `Budgeting App.xcodeproj` inside it. Xcode will show the app and test groups in the project navigator.

The repository has one level of project folders:

```text
Budgeting-App/
├── Budgeting App.xcodeproj
├── Budgeting App/
├── Budgeting AppTests/
├── Budgeting AppUITests/
└── README.md
```

## Build and test on a Mac

Use Xcode with SDKs and a simulator runtime supporting the project's deployment targets (currently 26.5). The project metadata records Xcode 26.6. Linux cannot build or run this app because SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Apple simulators require Apple's toolchain.

From the repository root, inspect your installed SDKs and simulator destinations:

```sh
xcodebuild -version
xcodebuild -showsdks
xcodebuild -list -project "Budgeting App.xcodeproj"
xcodebuild -showdestinations -project "Budgeting App.xcodeproj" -scheme "Budgeting App"
```

Choose an available iPhone simulator with an OS meeting the deployment target. Replace `SIMULATOR_UUID` with its identifier:

```sh
xcodebuild -project "Budgeting App.xcodeproj" -scheme "Budgeting App" \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=SIMULATOR_UUID' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/budgeting-app-derived build

xcodebuild -project "Budgeting App.xcodeproj" -scheme "Budgeting App" \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=SIMULATOR_UUID' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/budgeting-app-derived test
```

The scheme includes four unit tests for wallet balances, overdraft limits, recurring-payment rescheduling, and paused payments, plus a UI test that launches the app and opens Wallets. Run the UI test on an iPhone simulator, where the tab bar is visible. Test sources belong only to their test targets; app sources and assets belong only to the app target. `Info.plist` is processed as build configuration, not copied as a resource.

For a physical device or distribution, configure your own signing team in Xcode. Build and test commands above still need validation on macOS; Linux checks only establish project structure and file-reference integrity.
